- [kimmobrnfeldt/concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrnfeldt/concurrently) — Intertwines the output of each process, often becomes unreadable. (I was using this before)
- [rse/stmux](https://github.com/rse/stmux) — Proper terminal multiplexer. Allows input as well. Requires node-gyp. More powerful and hence more complex.
